Executive Summary
The use of data and analytics to excel online retail has become more pervasive. Therefore,
organizations, especially e-commerce companies with big-data support, must continue to improve the
use of data and analytics to stay ahead to enhance customer engagement and better predict human
behavior. Working with an e-commerce site’s data, models were built to understand customer purchasing
behavior as well as predicting the revenue. To accomplish this task a combination of logistic regression
and linear regression models were used to produce an expected value for transaction revenue by
customer ID. These models highlighted several variables that are helpful in future prediction of
transaction revenue as well as giving guidance to this ecommerce site’s marketing department. Based on
this analysis, it was found that the number of previous transactions and visits, number of page views
during the visit, when visits to the site happen, and several more characteristics or behaviors of a given
customer help to predict the likelihood of their expected transaction revenue. The deliverables produced
from this analysis include a file that estimates the log of transaction revenue of a test dataset for unique
customer ids and recommendations for both marketing efforts and future analyses.
